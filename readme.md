# JUMP hub

Repository to generate the one-in-all resource for morphological profiling, specialized in data from JUMP Cell Painting. [Here](https://broadinstitute.github.io/jump_hub/) is the main website.

This repository generates the website and also contains the dependencies to run the notebooks and ensure their correctness.

## Notes

Additionally, this repository can be used as a way to install essential dependencies for an exploratory analysis of JUMP morphological data.

Python notebooks are in the `colab` branch. Notebooks are autogenerated using [these](https://github.com/broadinstitute/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/tree/main/tools) scripts.
