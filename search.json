    "text": "Interactive Tools\nThere are several no-code options for exploring JUMP data. These are very useful for querying perturbations without needing experience in data analysis or programming. Detailed usage instructions are below this brief overview listing:\n\nJUMPer tools here\n\nType in your gene/compound of interest and retrieve a list of similar genes/compounds\n\nTools to browse images and inspect enriched features\n\nNo account creation required\n\nMorpheus here\n\nExplore matrices of data and perform basic calculations\nExplore heatmaps showing similarity among clustered samples\nNo account creation required\n\nArdigen phenAID JUMP-CP Explorer here\n\nSearch similarities among perturbations and more\nAccount creation required, but access is free\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nJUMPrr tools\n\nX_Feature: For each row, is the Feature value an average for all the cells in the Metadata_image using the listed Mask(region of the cell: Nucleus, Cell, or Cytoplasm)? Or is it associated with a single cell in that image?\nAny Feature is the average of all cells and all replicates (typically four in total) for the specific mask and feature.\nHow are Statistic and Median calculated for each row?\n\nStatistic is the probability of a given distribution (four replicates) to occur relative to their negative controls (in the four plates from which those replicates came; typically each replicate is in an independent plate).\nMedian is the median feature across all (~4) replicates. Each of these replicates’ value was in turn the mean of all the sites and cells in a given well.\n\nI have a compound and want to find the closest JUMP analog\n\n```{=html}\n\n```\n\n\nMorpheus\n\nHow can I use Morpheus to view relationships among samples?\n\n\nDownload the ORF and/or CRISPR data from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025602 or from https://zenodo.org/records/14165010 (a smaller file with only genes having cosine similarity &gt; 0.5 with other genes).\nDrag and drop one of those files into Morpheus (at https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/ in your web browser; no need to install it)\nGo to Tools &gt; Similarity Matrix and choose Metric = cosine similarity and Compute matrix for = Columns\nCluster the genes using Tools &gt; Hierarchical clustering (we recommend 1 minus Pearson correlation, but other options are fine) for both rows and columns\n\nClick the gear icon towards the top right and choose “Annotations” tab\n\nChoose Symbol (for Rows and Columns) so that gene names will appear. You can also choose various annotations of genes, like biological process or molecular function but those names are long and make it hard to see unless you have a huge screen.\n\nPlay around!\n\nTo find a gene of interest, in the search box type Symbol: then start typing the name and it will appear as highlighted in the scroll bar so you can scroll to find it. But if you are looking for top matches to a gene, note that clustering can have weird behavior, putting the closest match pretty far away depending on the other data points. The broad.io Datasette links (JUMPer tools) more directly answer the “top/bottom matches” question and take less hands-on time to configure and less compute time to load.\n\ndoubleclick a gene name and the data matrix will sort to show you the closest matches on one end and the strongest anti-correlators at the other. To go back to your original view, just keep clicking the same gene you originally sorted by, it will change back to the previous sort eventually.\n\nnote that in clustered view you can’t see anti-correlations which anecdotally seem more strong/common in CRISPR data. So clusters are a bit more interesting in ORF data.\n\nIf you would like to trim the similarity matrix to only show genes with a strong match, you can follow this procedure:\n\nAdd a new annotation by going to Tools &gt; Create Calculated Annotation, with the name ‘#Matches’ with the formula COUNTIF(“&gt;0.7”) This counts the number of genes where the similarity is above 0.7 (you can pick whatever threshold you prefer). Repeat this step for both rows and columns. Warning: although this seems like a simple step, for some reason it is fairly intensive and might require a suitably powerful computer - if the browser asks to Wait or Exit, waiting sometimes works.\n\nFilter samples where ‘#Matches’ &gt;=2 (because every sample matches itself); again repeat this for both rows and columns.\n\nThis will yield ~350 genes in the ORF data, for example. You can increase the number of matches to filter (to 3 or 4, as you prefer).",

The many features that are captured make up the profile of the cell or the population of cells in a sample.\n\nPhenotypic activity: Metric that indicates how well we can distinguish a perturbation from its negative controls, which quantifies how strong the phenotype is (Kalinin, et al. elaborates on the term).\n\nPhenotypic consistency: Metric that indicates how well a perturbation’s profile matches profiles of samples that are expected to be biologically related, according to an annotated resource (e.g., known gene-gene or compound-target interactions (Kalinin, et al.).\n\nPhenotypic distinctiveness: Metric showing how distinctive a perturbation is relative to the other perturbations in a given experiment (not limited to negative controls, as in phenotypic activity).\n\nCosine similarity: Metric capturing how close two vectors are. It assumes all the elements in them (usually features) have the same weight.\n\nRetrievability: Umbrella term for the methods that assess the quality of matching among a set of samples in a profiling experiment: phenotypic activity, consistency, and distinctiveness.\n\nConsensus profile: Aggregated profiles across all biological replicates (e.g., across all wells) of a given perturbation, generally it is the median of every feature.\n\n\n\n\nJUMP: Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling\n\nmAP: mean Average Precision (Kalinin, et al. explains mAP in the context of image-based profiling)\n\nCRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.

This allows searching for the closest matches for each perturbation of interest or looking at all relationships in a heatmap.\n‘X…significance…parquet’ is the statistical significance for the phenotypic activity of a given sample (see broad.io/crispr_feature for a formal definition). It shows which perturbations yielded a phenotype distinguishable from negative controls.\n‘full’ tables contain all the data points from the resulting analysis. Their non-full counterpart contains a subset comprised of the most significant entries, meant for in-browser consumption and queries.\nMany of the above tables can be interactively viewed using JUMPrr tools",
